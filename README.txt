INSTRUCTIONS
============

Changing a color scheme
-----------------------

Beatrix comes with 7 built-in color schemes including default, blue, blue-grey, cyan, green, light green and teal schemes. For each color option there is a separate “styles_color.css” file located in the /css folder (e.g. “styles_green.css”).  In order to activate a different color scheme you need to change the name of its styles file to “style.css” (e.g. rename “styles_green.css” to “style.css”).  All templates will then use this file as a default stylesheet.

Creating a custom color scheme
------------------------------

You can easily create your own color scheme with LESS files included. All color values are stored in the /less/colors.less file. After necessary changes are done you need to recompile the /less/styles.less file to /css/styles.css to enable a new color scheme.

Setting up the contact form
---------------------------

This template contains a fully functioning PHP contact form with spam protection powered by reCaptcha. 
Note: The contact form will not work in your local environment without a server that supports PHP. 
In order to set up the contact form, please follow the steps below:

1. Open the /config.php file and fill out the required information:

 - reCaptcha Public ($publickey) and Private ($privatekey) keys.
 Please go to https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create if you don't have the keys yet.
 - Sender name and email address ($mail_sender)
 This is a name and email address you will see in the “From:” line of new emails you will receive.
 - Your email address ($to_email)
 This is an email address new emails will be sent to.
 - Email subject ($mail_subject)
 This is a subject of new emails you will receive.

2. In the /index.html, /index_carousel.html and /contact.html files you need to insert your reCaptcha Public key (see Step 1) at the end of these lines:

http://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/challenge?k=YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY (e.g. http://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/challenge?k=09sdv0sf9v0sdf9b0df9b09dfb).

3. Save all files.
